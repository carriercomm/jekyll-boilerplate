# jekyll-boilerplate

My boilerplate Jekyll setup. Includes:
- Bundler
- Sass setup (SMACSS style)
- My basic includes structure

These are just some super basic things I find myself often doing at the beginning of many new Jekyll setups.

## Usage

### Setup

1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-boilerplate.git`
2. Rename the directory for your own use, or copy the files into your existing repository.
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Build on what's there!

### Running locally

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
2. Open `localhost:4000` in your browser

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have suggestions. Since this is primarily for personal use, if I think it will be useful to me I'll merge the pull. But if not, feel free to just fork my setup and customize for your own needs. :sparkles: :heart:
